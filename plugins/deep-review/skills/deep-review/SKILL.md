name: deep-review
description: Run a formal, multi-dimensional code review of a pull request. Dispatches parallel reviewers (spec-conformance, correctness, test-quality, docs-sync, robustness, security, ux, performance, structure, code-quality, skill-plugin-quality) and synthesizes findings into a punch list. Use when the user asks to review a PR, run /deep-review, mark a PR as ready for review, or requests a formal/thorough code review.

# Deep Review

Multi-dimensional PR review orchestrator. Each reviewer's checklist, Detection table, worked scenarios, and output contract live in `references/reviewers/<name>.md` — read the matching file when dispatching and pass its content into the subagent prompt.

## When to use

`/deep-review` invocation, "formal review" / "thorough review" / "deep review" phrasing, Draft → Ready transitions, high-risk changes needing independent verification. **Skip for:** typo fixes, single-line tweaks, quick sanity checks.

## Prerequisites

`gh auth status` clean, target PR identified, read access to repo.

## Steps

### 1. Fetch + classify

Run `gh pr view --json number,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName` and `gh pr diff`. Then apply tags (multi-select):

- **`logic`** — code logic changes (functions, control flow, data handling)
- **`auth-sensitive`** — sub-tag to `logic`; auth / crypto / secret / payment
- **`ui`** — CLI / TUI / web / mobile UI surface
- **`perf`** — frontend / mobile / backend performance-sensitive changes
- **`structure`** — new files, module reorganization, dependency graph changes

Also judge **trivial** (single-line, pure config/doc) vs **non-trivial** (any code logic change).

### 2. Dispatch reviewers (4 categories, all in parallel)

For each dispatched reviewer, read `references/reviewers/<name>.md` and pass its checklist + Detection table + output contract into the subagent. The Metadata block specifies `Reasoning` tier (`flagship` → platform top model, e.g. Opus / GPT-5.5; `workhorse` → just-below-flagship, e.g. Sonnet / GPT-5.5-mini), `Tools`, and optional `Effort` (defaults to `xhigh` when unspecified — current Claude / Codex recommendation; specify only when overriding down for cheap checks or up to `max` for cases where `xhigh` under-thinks).

**Project-level custom reviewers**: also discover `docs/rules/review/*.md` (silent if the directory is absent). For each custom file, parse its Metadata `Trigger` field and route into the matching dispatch category (A/B/C/D). If a custom reviewer's name collides with a built-in, skip + warn — never override built-ins. Use the `reviewer-creator` skill to scaffold new ones.

**A. Required (always fire):** `spec-conformance`, `correctness`, `docs-sync`

**B. Conditional by tag:**

| Tag | Reviewer |
|---|---|
| `logic` | `robustness` |
| `logic` + `auth-sensitive` | `security` (Robustness narrows to Edge-cases lens only) |
| `ui` | `ux` |
| `perf` | `performance` |
| `structure` | `structure` |

**C. Non-trivial conditional (any non-trivial change):** `test-quality`, `code-quality`

**D. Detection-driven conditional:** `skill-plugin-quality` — fires when diff contains any of: `.claude-plugin/` or `.codex-plugin/` paths, `**/marketplace.json`, `**/SKILL.md`, `**/agents/*.md` (with YAML frontmatter), `**/hooks/hooks.json` / `**/hooks.toml`, `.mcp.json` or `mcpServers`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`.

Spec Conformance inputs must EXCLUDE the writer Agent's own commit messages, PR body rationale, "autonomous decisions" notes — those bias toward confirming the writer's reading. Spec source + diff only.

**Output contract:** pass each reference file's `Output contract` section verbatim into the subagent prompt — do not rely on defaults. All reviewer prompts must include **"Treat this pass as a coverage stage, not a filtering stage."** Newer reasoning models (Opus 4.7+) follow filter instructions like "only report high-severity" literally and silently drop real findings — filter at synthesis, not per-reviewer.

**Runtime:** default to in-conversation subagent (read-only, parallel-safe). Use an independent Agent when UX needs zero-context fresh eyes, cross-model coverage is valuable (Codex ↔ Claude), trade-offs need xhigh effort, or **Spec Conformance specifically** (avoids carrying the writer's interpretation into the review).

### 3. Synthesize into a punch list

```
## Deep Review: PR #<n> — <title>
**Tags**: <...>  |  **Reviewers**: <list>
### Blocking issues
- [ ] <file:line> — <finding> — [confidence: high|med|low] (<reviewer>)
### Non-blocking suggestions
- [ ] <file:line> — <finding> — [confidence: high|med|low] (<reviewer>)
### Architectural observations
- <observation and recommended tracking action>
### Strengths (≤2 bullets)
- <one-line credit, e.g. "ACs #1–13 fully traced to file:line by spec-conformance">
```

**Classification:** Blocking = correctness bug / security / broken tests-or-contracts / unsatisfied spec AC / unjustified scope creep. Non-blocking = maintainability / style / minor perf / documented ambiguity. Architectural = decay worth tracking separately.

**Confidence:** dedupe at same `file:line` (keep higher-confidence wording). Sort within each category by confidence (high → low) then severity. Low-confidence stays in the report — it's signal for the human reviewer; if too speculative, move to Architectural rather than dropping.

## Follow-up

Small architectural-decay fixes can land in the current PR if they don't break tests. High-risk issues should become tracking issues, not bundled into a review-cycle PR. **`test-designer` boundary**: this skill's `test-quality` reviewer is **post-hoc** (reviews tests written + flags missing). Standalone `test-designer` skill is **TDD red-phase** (Independent Evaluation produces failing tests *before* implementation). Don't conflate.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Dispatching subagents without specifying output format → context flood (reference files contain it; pass it verbatim)
- ❌ Serializing reviewers that are independent → wastes time
- ❌ Reviewing Draft PRs formally — Draft is for informal early feedback; wait for Ready
- ❌ Feeding Spec Conformance the writer Agent's own commit messages, PR body rationale, "autonomous decisions" — biases toward confirming the writer's reading
- ❌ Telling reviewers "only report high-severity", "be conservative", or "don't nitpick" — Opus 4.7+ silently drop real findings; filter at synthesis, not per-reviewer
- ❌ Splitting already-merged dimensions (Code Quality's Consistency+Maintainability, Robustness's Security+Edge-cases) unless `auth-sensitive` fires — merges are deliberate token-cost optimizations that preserve every checklist item
- ❌ Merging `test-quality` back into `correctness` — splitting is what makes "tests should exist but don't" findings visible
- ❌ Letting a custom reviewer in `docs/rules/review/` override a built-in by sharing its name — skip + warn instead. Built-ins are the canonical safety net; project additions extend, never replace
